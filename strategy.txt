## Strategy:

# 1) To choose stocks to purchase for a given month:
#       a) choose top n (250) positive returning stocks over the last 12
#          months 
#       b) choose top m (100) returning stocks over the last 6 
#          months from the set n
#       c) choose top l (10) returning stocks over the last 3 
#          months from the set m.  These are the stocks that will be 
#          in the portfolio in any given month.

# 2) Hold cash if the previous month's sp500 had negative returns

# Results: 
I think the worst part of this strategy was relying on wikipedia for 
the changes to the sp500, and using yahoo finance blindly to get 
historical prices.  At the early 2000's there were less than 400 stocks 
that I had price information for.  This was adapted for in my strategy, 
but it was not ideal.  Also, I manually filtered out some data that was 
clearly erroneous, aka >5X monthly returns, but I'm sure there were
other discrepancies that I didn't catch.  Rather than using sp500 
historical data, I could theoretically search for companies by market 
cap historically.

# Room for experimentation:
#   a) intramonth stop losses?
#   b) different time horizons, etc top l gaining stocks last month
#   c) different number of stocks chosen, currently half>100>10
#   d) booking profits at intervals: ex book 50% at 8% gain, 
#      book remaining 50% at 16% gain
#   e) If a stock stays in the rotation for multiple months, I will not 
#      sell any of it off until it goes out of the rotation.  At that
#      point, I will sell, put profit into newly chosen stock at a value
#      of 10% of total portfolio, and then distribute excess into all
#      10 stocks evenly

# Note: This strategy will only pick stocks that have been in the 
# S&P 500 for at least 12 months.


# Machine Learning:
# Eventually, I could turn this into a machine learning model
#
# Split the returns data into 2 year timeframes
#
# test out different parameters:
#      param1 = # 12 month stocks to selected
#      param2 = # 6 month stocks to selected
#      param3 = # 3 month stocks to selected
#      param4 = selloff strategy
#
# Each x value would be some parameter permutation matched with
#      a random two year period.  For this period, the first year
#      is purely for calculations and returns would be calculated
#      for the second year
#      
# With enough permutations of parameters, I could fit a linear regression
#      on the four parameters and get a sense of how they effect the strategy 
#      on average
#
# I would have to keep in mind a restraint option for the parameters:
#      12month # > 6month # > 3month #
